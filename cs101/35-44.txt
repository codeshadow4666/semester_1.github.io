 ..................MCQS..............................
 -AND operations are useful when manipulating
  other types of bit map.
.........................................................

 
....................MCQS ENDING..........................
 a machineâ€™s instructions can be categorized into three 
groupings: 
.........................................................
(1) the data transfer group,
.........................................................
he data transfer group consists of instructions that request
 the movement of data from one location to 
another.
First step:
-Load :      from memory to registor
Second step:
-Store:        registor to memory
.........................................................
.........................................................
I/O instructions:
.........................................................
 Such instructions handle the input/output (I/O) activities
  of the machine, they are called I/O instructions
.........................................................
(2) the arithmetic/logic group,
.........................................................
.........................................................
Perfom arithmetic operation & also logic( boolaen 
Operation like AND OR XOR ,SHIFT,ROTATE)
.........................................................
.........................................................
(3) the control group.
.........................................................
Perfom CONTROL instructions like Jump (branch),
conditional & Unconditional jump
.........................................................
..................Logic Operators(38)....................
.........................................................
AND:       real life use

here is a binary number 10011101  
if you want to that last 4 bit will not change then
here is a technique called masking.

1001 1101
0000 1111     AND
...........
0000 1101         last 4 bit has not change

EXAMPLE: 
In RGB color if we want to eliminate red then we use this
 technique.In RGB 3 color contain 1 byte 1 byte 1 byte
.........................................................
OR:         Real life use
.........................................................
If we want to change specific bit without changing other
bits then we use OR;

1001 1101     if want to change 3rd bit from left to right then 
0010 0000 OR    just use bit 1 & perform or operation
...........
1011 1101
.........................................................
.........................................................
XOR:       Real life use
.........................................................
It's used to invert the images color 
it convert the 0 to 1 & 1 to 0.
EXAMPLE:

1001 1101
1111 1111     XOR
...........
0110 0010 
.........................................................

.........................................................
.................Rotation & Shift(39)....................
.........................................................
Circular shift or rotation;

onsider a register containing a byte of bits. 
If we shift its contents one bit to the right
we imagine the rightmost bit falling off the edge and 
a hole appearing at the leftmost end.One technique is to place the 
bit that fell off the right end in the hole at the left end.

EXAMPLE:

suppose  a byte 
10101 0011     we perform Right Circular Shift on it
               last bit (here is 1) will shift to start
110101 001               

.........................................................
.........................................................
Logical Shift:
.........................................................

Another technique is to discard the bit that falls 
off the edge and always fill the hole with a 0. The term 
logical shift is used for such operation.

.........................................................
Arithematic Shift:
.........................................................
Shifts that leave the sign bit unchanged are sometimes 
called arithmetic shifts.
.........................................................

.....................Controller(41)......................
Controller:
.........................................................
Communication between a computer and other devices 
is normally handled through an intermediary 
apparatus known as a controller.
                  or
In computer system an controller a chip, expansion card or 
stand-alone device used to Communicate with peripheral 
devices. It's work like a link between computer & 
peripheral devices.

Ports:

controller connects the peripheral via cable. In computer
there are many connectors also known as ports used to connect
the peripheral devices .

.........................................................
...................DMA (Direct Memory Access).............
Direct memory access is a feature of computer systems that 
allows certain hardware subsystems to access main 
memory independent of the central processing unit
             or
DMA is a ability of computer system that allows the computer's
subsystems to independently access the main memory without 
depending on the CPU.
.........................................................
Bottle Neck:
.........................................................
If CPU & other subsystems of computer competing for the same
bus then such problem called bottle neck.
.........................................................
.........................................................
Handshaking:
.........................................................
CPU is very much faster than peripheral devices.Such as printer
can't print page fastly so, CPU can't wait for printer to print 
page. there to solve this problem we use handskaing technique.
According to handskaing technique printer will tell the CPU when 
it will free to receive data . so, Cpu can perform other task 
during it.
.........................................................


....................Serial & parallel(43)..................
.........................................................
serial Communication:
one signal at one time
only have one path
slower than parrallel
for short distance 
example:
 usb,Fireware

parallel Communication:

several singnal at the same time on different paths
have many path 
very faster 
for longer distances
Example:

-Ethernet


..................throughput & pipelining...................
Throughput:
 
Amout of work done by a machine in the given time.
.........................................................
pipelining:
.........................................................
it's used to increase the throughput of the computer.
Pipelining is an  technique where multiple 
instructions are overlapped in execution.
by this technique, computer does't need to wait for finishing 
perivous tasks.
